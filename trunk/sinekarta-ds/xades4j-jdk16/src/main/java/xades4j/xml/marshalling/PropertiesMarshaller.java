/**
 * Interface for property data objects marshallers.
 * <p>
 * The signed and unsigned properties are marshalled at a different time in the
 * signature production. The separation comes from the nature of the properties:
 * signed properties need to be marshalled before the signature so that they are
 * covered by a {@code Reference}. On the other hand, unsigned properties do not
 * need to be marshalled before the signature and most of the times they can't be,
 * because they use information that results from the signature generation.
 * <p>
 * Built-in implementations of signed and unsigned properties data objects marshallers
 * are based on JAXB and support all the signed properties data objects in the library
 * (XAdES 1.4.1) plus the {@code GenericDOMData}.
 * @see SignedPropertiesMarshaller
 * @see UnsignedPropertiesMarshaller
