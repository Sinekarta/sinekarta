 * Base class for the {@code CommitmentTypeIndication} property. This is a signed property
 * that qualifies signed data objects. In consequence, XAdES signatures may contain
 * more than one {@code CommitmentTypeIndication}.
 * <p>
 * Although the same XML element is used when the property applies to some or all
 * data objects there two different types in order to control the number of targets:
 * if the commitment applies to all the signed data objects {@link AllDataObjsCommitmentTypeProperty AllDataObjsCommitmentTypeProperty}
 * should be used; otherwise use {@link CommitmentTypeProperty CommitmentTypeProperty}.
