 * Base class for the {@code SignaturePolicyIdentifier} property. The signature

 * <p>
 * Although there is only one XML element indicating if the signature policiy is
 * explicit or implied, two different classes exist to represent those situations.
 * <p>
 * This property cannot be supplied directly. It is enforced by the {@link xades4j.production.XadesSigner}
 * producing a XAdES-EPES.
