= How to create a development environment =

== Download and compile sources ==

 * download and install 4.2.f version of alfresco. 
  * from now these instructions refers to an Alfresco installation done on Ubuntu Linux using sudo
  * Alfresco installation dir is  /opt/alfresco-4.2.f.skds
 * download sources from svn repository https://sinekarta.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
 * we use eclipse as development environment. We also use jboss tools for maven integration
 * import following maven projects : 
  * sinekarta-ds/itext-jdk16 (patch to itext for bouncycastle jdk16 support)
  * sinekarta-ds/xades4j-jdk16 (patch to xades4j for bouncycastle jdk16 support)
  * sinekarta-ds/sinekarta-ds-applet (sign applet)
  * sinekarta-ds (super project)
   * sinekarta-ds/sinekarta-ds-alfresco (Alfresco core plugin)
   * sinekarta-ds/sinekarta-ds-commons (commons tools and utilities)
   * sinekarta-ds/sinekarta-ds-core (core signature algorithms)
   * sinekarta-ds/sinekarta-ds-share (alfresco share plugin)
   * sinekarta-ds/sinekarta-ds-integration (integration test)
 * select all projects, right click and run maven update (force update of snapshot if necessary)

 === Now you should have a running eclipse workspace (no compilation problems) ===

These are projects : 
 * sinekarta-ds (generic project)
 * itext-jdk16 (java project)
 * xades4j-jdk16 (java project)
 * sinekarta-ds-alfresco (java project)
 * sinekarta-ds-commons (java project)
 * sinekarta-ds-core (java project)
 * sinekarta-ds-share (java project)
 * sinekarta-ds-applet (java project)
 * sinekarta-ds-integration (java project)

== Running the build ==

 * install itext-jdk16 on local repository : 
  * right click on /itext-jdk16/pom.xml
  * Run As -> Maven install
  * wait for "BUILD SUCCESS" in eclipse console
 * install xades4j-jdk16 on local repository : 
  * right click on /xades4j-jdk16/pom.xml
  * Run As -> Maven install
  * wait for "BUILD SUCCESS" in eclipse console
 * install sinekarta-ds-applet on local repository : 
  * right click on /sinekarta-ds-applet/pom.xml
  * Run As -> Maven install
  * wait for "BUILD SUCCESS" in eclipse console
 * create a directory named work in your workspace directory 
 * copy alfresco.war and share.war (you can find these on /opt/alfresco-4.2.f.skds/tomcat/webapps) into work directory created
  * could be that you have to use sudo to make the copy
  * could be that you have to change permissions and/or ownership
 * rename alfresco.war in .alfresco-original.war (hidden file)
 * rename share.war in .share-original.war (hidden file)
 * update sinekarta-ds
  * select sinekarta-ds project 
  * right click /sinekarta-ds
  * Maven -> Update Project ...
  * select all
  * press ok and wait for  maven update finish
 * put your JENIA_Software.p12 (official certificate for applet sign) in your workspace directory
 * resolve dependencies for ant tasks : 
  * right click /sinekarta-ds/pom.xml
  * Run As -> Maven build...
  * set "package" in "Goals" field
  * press "Run" button
  * wait for "BUILD SUCCESS" in eclipse console

== Result of build ==

You can find these artifact as result of build process : 
 * sinekarta-ds/sinekarta-ds-alfresco/target/dist/sinekarta-ds-alfresco.amp - amp to be installed into alfresco
 * sinekarta-ds/sinekarta-ds-share/target/dist/sinekarta-ds-share.amp - amp to be installed into share

To install amps into alfresco and share war, please refer to alfresco-mmt tool documentation.

You also have a full version of alfresco.war and share.war "amped" into work directory.

== Launch Alfresco ==

Now you have an alfresco.war and share.war into work directory.
Move/copy these war ino /opt/alfresco-4.2.f.skds/tomcat/webapps replacing originals.
Now you can run Alfresco.

== Debugging of share extension == 

 * go to Window->preferences
 * server->runtime environment
 * click add
 * select Apache Tomcat 7.0 and click next
 * set /opt/alfresco-4.2.f.skds/tomcat as installation directory
 * click finish

 * select "servers" and press ok
 * rigth click on servers view
 * new->server
 * select "apache tomcat 7"
 * click finish
 * double click on server created
 * in Ports section set (these port MUST be different from Alfresco port)
  * tomcat admin port to 7005
  * http to 7080
  * ajp to 7009
  * ssl to 7443 
 * select "module"s tab
 * press "add external web module"
 * set "docuemnt base" to < workspacedir >/work/share (your work directory)
 * set path to /share
 * save tomcat server configuration

start tomcat and go to : http://localhost:7080/share


== If you need to modify the applet... ==

If you have to modify the applet sources, please does not forgot to call maven install on sinekarta-ds-applet on your local maven repository before to run skds tests.
